R4: A SpriteKit in 3D
===

R4 is a 3D graphics rendering and animation libray based on Apple's SpriteKit Framework. Goal of the library is to ease creation of 3D games and applications by providing an infrastructure whose interface resembles interface of the SpriteKit. Someone who is familiar with SpriteKit shouldn't have any problems working with this libaray. Concepts that apply to SpriteKit also apply to R4, just with additional space dimension.

The library is in an early phase of the development and lacks some of the SpriteKit's counterparts, most notably physical subsystem, but it's usable for the creation of a simple 3D scenes. It provides scene graph infrastructure with drawable nodes like entities and particle emitters, non-drawable nodes like cameras and lights, and scene managers to organize and improve rendering process.
