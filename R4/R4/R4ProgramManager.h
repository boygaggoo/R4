/*!
  R4ProgramManager handles creation and lifecycle management of programs and shaders. It ensures that there are never two identical shaders or programs in memory and provides a caching mechanism for shaders and programs.
 
 @discussion You should use this class to create shader objects as it provides caching mechanism and ensures that there are never two identical shaders in memory.
 
 @warning Usually you don't create program objects by yourself. Program objects are created from R4Pass when you specify its vertex and fragment shader.
